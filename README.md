👋 Hey there!
I'm Ebenezer — a certified Product Manager currently diving deep into server-side sorcery through the ALX Backend Engineering program 🧪🖥️.

Over the last decade, I’ve led some pretty cool digital products in fintech, FMCG, and recruitment spaces — from launching a B2B platform at HEINEKEN Ethiopia 🍺 to building an invoice discounting system for SMEs 🌾. Now, I’m channeling that energy into enriching my server side skills, writing clean and efficient code as well as building systems that scale.

🚀 Check out some of my recent experiments and pet projects here: github.com/Sly-ai
Highlights include:

🧬 HealBloc: a proof-of-concept for a blockchain-powered universal medical records system

🛠️ Python, SQL, and shell projects from my ALX journey

🧪 Constant tinkering, learning, and leveling up

When I’m not coding or planning my next roadmap, I’m probably sipping buna ☕, geeking out over design systems, or mapping out user journeys on a Miro board.

Let’s build something amazing! 💡✨
